# Diabetes-Predictor
Our goal in this study is to predict if a patient has diabetes or not based on a variety of factors such as blood sugar levels, insulin levels, age, and BMI. We'll take care of everything from data collection to model deployment. We examine multiple machine learning algorithms using the accuracy score measure during Model evaluation to select the best one. Then, using Flask, a Python micro framework, we build a web app.
